# The behavior of RuboCop can be controlled via the .rubocop.yml
# configuration file. It makes it possible to enable/disable
# certain cops (checks) and to alter their behavior if they accept
# any parameters. The file can be placed either in your home
# directory or in some project directory.
#
# RuboCop will start looking for the configuration file in the directory
# where the inspected file is and continue its way up to the root directory.
#
# See https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/configuration

  VersionAdded: '0.36'
  VersionChanged: '0.79'
  EnforcedStyle: never
  SupportedStyles:
    # `always` will always add the frozen string literal comment to a file
    # regardless of the Ruby version or if `freeze` or `<<` are called on a
    # string literal. It is possible that this will create errors.
    - always
    # `always_true` will add the frozen string literal comment to a file,
    # similarly to the `always` style, but will also change any disabled
    # comments (e.g. `# frozen_string_literal: false`) to be enabled.
    - always_true
    # `never` will enforce that the frozen string literal comment does not
    # exist in a file.
